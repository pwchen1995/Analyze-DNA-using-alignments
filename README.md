# Analyze-DNA-using-alignments
WSU spring 2020 Computational Genomics final project

The idea is to build application that analyze DNA sequence using both global alignment and local alignment. Along with the COVID pandemic, this project does not only analyzing past DNA sequence like SARS but also compare the recent DNA virus - COVID.

* Ability to run local alignment
* Ability to run global alignment

Install/Execute:

To run this application, make sure you have compiler installed. Execute "gcc <sourcefile_name>.cpp -o <outputfile>.exe", afterward, Execute <outputfile>.exe. Dataset can be replace as your choice, this applicatino accept data file size up to 35,000 characters.
